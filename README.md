This fork adds pug.js to the original project, allowing you to store each slide in a separate file.
Fyi: I don't put dist directory in .gitignore, so you can see the difference between versions of your presentation.

reveal.js is an open source HTML presentation framework. It enables anyone with a web browser to create beautiful presentations for free. Check out the live demo at [revealjs.com](https://revealjs.com/).

The framework comes with a powerful feature set including [nested slides](https://revealjs.com/vertical-slides/), [Markdown support](https://revealjs.com/markdown/), [Auto-Animate](https://revealjs.com/auto-animate/), [PDF export](https://revealjs.com/pdf-export/), [speaker notes](https://revealjs.com/speaker-view/), [LaTeX typesetting](https://revealjs.com/math/), [syntax highlighted code](https://revealjs.com/code/) and an [extensive API](https://revealjs.com/api/).

## Usage
First, install dependencies and run the server:
```
npm install
npm start
```
Then modify the slides in the `src/pug/slides` directory.
You can add new slides by creating new `.pug` files in the `src/pug/slides` directory.
The `index.pug` file is the main file that will be rendered. Don't forget to add your new slides to it.
